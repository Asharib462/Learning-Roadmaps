**“What is Software Construction?” *(Code Complete, 2nd Ed., §1.1)***


### 1. High-level idea

* **“Construction” is the hands-on work of building software**, analogous to erecting a house rather than merely sketching one.  It is where ideas become working code.&#x20;
* It is **more than just typing code**; it involves creativity, judgement, testing and integration. Hence “programming” or “coding” are acceptable synonyms, but “coding” alone understates the discipline involved.&#x20;

### 2. Place in the development lifecycle

| Up-front                          | **Construction (focus of the grey circle)**                                                                    | Afterward                               |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Problem definition & requirements | **Detailed design, coding & debugging, construction planning, unit testing, integration, integration testing** | System testing & corrective maintenance |

Construction sits in the middle of the process, consuming a large share of total project time and providing the artefact (source code) that every later activity relies on.

### 3. Core activities included

1. **Laying the groundwork** – confirming prerequisites are in place.
2. **Designing & writing classes/routines** (includes detailed design decisions).
3. **Creating & naming variables / constants.**
4. **Choosing control structures; organising statements.**
5. **Unit & integration testing; debugging your own code.**
6. **Code reviews (giving & receiving).**
7. **Polishing code** – formatting, commenting, self-documenting.
8. **Integrating separately built components.**
9. **Performance tuning & resource optimisation.**&#x20;

### 4. Activities **not** counted as construction

* Project management
* Requirements development
* High-level (architectural) design
* User-interface design
* Independent system testing
* Ongoing maintenance&#x20;

These still affect project success, but they are distinct disciplines with their own best practices.

### 5. Key characteristics

* Central & unavoidable: no matter how rushed a project, construction always happens.
* Source code produced during construction often becomes the **only up-to-date, authoritative documentation** of the system.
* Quality of construction strongly influences overall software quality, maintainability and developer productivity.&#x20;

**Sound-bite definition**

> *Software construction is the creative, detail-oriented phase of software development in which developers transform designs into working code—performing detailed design, coding, debugging, unit & integration testing, integration and tuning—to produce the executable system.*
