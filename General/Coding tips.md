### 8 Key Take-Home Lessons (and how to act on them)

| # | Insight                                                | Why it matters                                               | Try this next                                                                                                    |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **You don’t need everything memorised.**               | Great devs *google* daily; mastery is knowing where to look. | Keep a “quick links” doc of your favourite docs/search tricks; add to it every time you look something up twice. |
| 2 | **Learn *how* to learn before cramming more syntax.**  | Passive tutorial-binging feels productive but rarely sticks. | For every **1 h** of video, spend **4 h** coding your own spin-off project—no video, no copy-paste.              |
| 3 | **Perfection is a trap.**                              | Pixel-perfect code that never ships teaches you nothing.     | Push ugly, working code; schedule refactor sessions *after* release, not before.                                 |
| 4 | **You’ll never “feel ready”—ship anyway.**             | Confidence follows action, not the other way round.          | Apply for that gig or publish that side project today; treat fear as a green light.                              |
| 5 | **Problem-solving beats typing speed.**                | Debugging *is* the job; syntax is just your notebook.        | When stuck, write the problem in plain language, list assumptions, then test them one by one.                    |
| 6 | **Stakeholders care about outcomes, not clever code.** | Value > vanity; users notice features, not abstractions.     | Frame every commit message as a user benefit (“Reduce page load by 300 ms”, not “Refactor utils”).               |
| 7 | **Burnout is real—protect the battery.**               | Exhausted brains write bugs and quit early.                  | Use “50 min work / 10 min break” blocks, get outside daily, and stop coding at a set time.                       |
| 8 | **Summarise & share what you learn.**                  | Teaching reinforces memory and builds reputation.            | After each project, write a short “What I learned” post or gist; future-you will thank you.                      |

**Quick recap in one line:**
Know enough to get unstuck, build more than you watch, ship messy, start early, debug like a detective, deliver value, rest often, and teach what you discover.
