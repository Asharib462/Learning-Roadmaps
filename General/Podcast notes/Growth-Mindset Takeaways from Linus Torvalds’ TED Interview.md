### Growth-Mindset Takeaways from Linus Torvalds’ TED Interview

* **Intrinsic curiosity drives mastery**

  * Began Linux “for fun” and because he loved programming; the joy of building kept him learning long after the novelty wore off.

* **Start small, iterate relentlessly**

  * Linux began as a solo side project; the big leap wasn’t “going viral” but moving from *one* developer to a *dozen*. Continuous micro-improvements compounded into a global platform.

* **Seek (and celebrate) feedback**

  * The first breakthrough wasn’t code contributions—it was people emailing suggestions. External critique became fuel, not threat.

* **Share early, worry less**

  * Overcame the fear of others “stealing” his work by open-sourcing it. Openness multiplied progress far beyond what solo effort could achieve.

* **Community multiplies learning**

  * Thousands now refine the kernel; Git itself was invented just to manage that learning loop. Scaling knowledge transfer is a super-power.

* **Persistence beats flashiness**

  * Describes himself as “stubborn,” focused on fixing the pothole in front of him rather than chasing big visions. Long, steady grind > momentary brilliance.

* **Embrace different strengths**

  * Admits poor UI skills and limited people skills, yet values teammates who excel there. Growth mindset recognizes complementary talents instead of trying to be good at everything.

* **Taste = continuous refinement**

  * Shows two code snippets to illustrate elevating a messy special-case into a clean general solution. Growth is honing judgment about quality, not just adding features.

* **Silence, focus, and deep work matter**

  * Keeps a distraction-free office so he can enter flow. A growth mindset protects the conditions that enable learning.

* **Impact can follow passion projects**

  * Neither Linux nor Git began with a grand strategy; both were tools he personally needed. Solve real problems well and scale can follow organically.

* **Open source as a learning laboratory**

  * Because the code is public, every contribution is a peer-reviewed lesson. Transparency accelerates collective mastery.

Use these principles—curiosity, iteration, feedback, openness, persistence, collaboration, and continual refinement—to cultivate your own growth mindset in any domain.
