# Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs) taking Llama 2 as an example

## What is a Large Language Model?

A Large Language Model (LLM) is an artificial intelligence system based on deep learning, specifically a neural network called a Transformer, trained on massive amounts of text data to understand, generate, and interact using human language.

### Core Definition
- An AI system based on deep learning and Transformer architecture
- Trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human language
- Capable of performing various language tasks without explicit rules for each task

### Key Characteristics
- Uses Transformer architecture for processing sequential data
- Contains billions (or even trillions) of parameters
- Trained on diverse datasets (websites, books, code, conversations)
- Can generalize to many tasks without task-specific training
- Capable of tasks like:
  - Answering questions
  - Writing code
  - Summarizing text
  - Translating languages
  - Generating creative content

### Technical Components

- A large language model is essentially two files:
  1. A parameters file (weights of the neural network)
  2. A run file (code that executes the neural network)
  - Example: The run file can be as simple as ~500 lines of C code with no dependencies

- Example: Llama 2 70B model
  - 70 billion parameter model
  - Open weights model (unlike closed models like ChatGPT)
  - Parameters file is ~140GB (each parameter stored as 2 bytes)
  - Can be run locally with just these two files
  - Can be run on a MacBook (though 70B model would run about 10x slower than the 7B model)

## Training Process

### Stage 1: Pre-training
- Involves compressing a large chunk of internet text (~10TB)
- Requires significant computational resources:
  - ~6,000 GPUs
  - ~12 days of training
  - Cost: ~$2 million
- Creates a "lossy compression" of the internet
- The model learns to predict the next word in a sequence
- Through this task, the model implicitly learns about the world
- Example: When trained on Wikipedia articles, the model learns about historical figures, events, and concepts without explicit teaching. When asked to generate the articles it generate random articles, e.g: relate to accounts, fish etc. But the thing is we can say which info is correct and which one is false. And this is called the model hallucination(dreaming). The model is fed with a lot of data and so kinda known the all the information about the suggest and predicts it. and this info may be or may not be correct


### Stage 2: Fine-tuning
- Transforms the model into an "assistant"
- Uses high-quality, manually created Q&A datasets
- Quality over quantity (e.g., ~100,000 carefully crafted conversations)
- Changes the model's behavior to respond in a helpful assistant format
- Remarkably, the model retains knowledge from pre-training while adopting new behavior
- Example: After fine-tuning, the model can answer questions like "Can you help me with this code? print Hello World" in a helpful assistant format, even if this specific question wasn't in the training set

## How LLMs Work

- Core task: Next word prediction
  - Example: Given "cat sat on a", predicts the next word (e.g., "mat" with 97% probability)
- Uses Transformer neural network architecture
- Parameters are distributed throughout the network
- While we understand the mathematical operations, the exact role of each parameter is not fully understood
- Knowledge is stored in a complex, sometimes "weird" way
  - Example: Can answer "Who is Tom Cruz's mother?" but not "Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?"
  - Example: The model can generate text about a "black nose days" fish with roughly correct information, even though it never saw this exact text in training

## Key Characteristics

- Mostly empirical artifacts
- Not fully interpretable (unlike traditional engineering systems)
- Can generate text that follows patterns from training data
  - Example: Can generate Java code, Amazon product listings, or Wikipedia articles that look authentic but are completely made up
  - Example: Can generate ISBN numbers that look real but don't actually exist
- Capable of both memorization and novel generation
- Knowledge is stored in a lossy, compressed format
- Can hallucinate (generate plausible but incorrect information)
  - Example: The model might generate a plausible-looking ISBN number that doesn't actually exist

## Current State

- State-of-the-art models require significantly more resources than the example numbers
  - Example: Modern models like GPT-4 or Claude require 10x or more resources than the Llama 2 70B example
- Training runs can cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars
- Active research in interpretability and mechanistic understanding
- Sophisticated evaluation methods required due to empirical nature
- The field is rapidly evolving, with new architectures and training methods being developed

## Scaling Laws in LLMs

### What are Scaling Laws?
- Mathematical relationships that describe how model performance scales with:
  - Model size (number of parameters)
  - Training data size
  - Computational resources
  - Training time

### Key Findings
- Performance improves predictably with:
  - Increased model size
  - More training data
  - More compute resources
- The relationship follows a power law:
  - Performance ∝ (Model Size)^α
  - Performance ∝ (Training Data)^β
  - Where α and β are constants typically between 0.07 and 0.1

### Implications
- Larger models generally perform better
- More training data leads to better performance
- There are diminishing returns to scaling
- The relationship holds across different model architectures
- Helps in predicting performance of larger models

### Practical Considerations
- Helps in resource allocation decisions
- Guides model development strategies
- Influences cost-benefit analysis of training larger models
- Important for understanding the limits of current approaches

## Practical Demonstrations and Examples

### Text Generation Examples
- The model can generate various types of content that mimic its training data:
  - Java code snippets
  - Amazon product listings
  - Wikipedia articles
  - Example: Generated product listings include realistic-looking but fictional ISBN numbers

### Knowledge Demonstration
- The model can generate factual content about various topics:
  - Example: Generated information about the "black nose days" fish was roughly correct
  - Shows the model's ability to combine and apply knowledge from training
  - Demonstrates both memorization and novel generation capabilities

### Assistant Behavior
- After fine-tuning, the model can:
  - Answer coding questions (e.g., "Can you help me with this code? print Hello World")
  - Provide helpful responses in an assistant-like format
  - Maintain knowledge from pre-training while adopting new behavior patterns

### Limitations and Quirks
- The "reversal curse" phenomenon:
  - Can answer "Who is Tom Cruz's mother?" correctly
  - But fails to answer "Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?"
  - Demonstrates the one-dimensional nature of some knowledge storage

### Running the Model
- Practical demonstration shows:
  - Model can run locally on a MacBook
  - 70B parameter model runs about 10x slower than 7B model
  - Only requires two files (parameters and run file)
  - No internet connection needed for inference

## Comprehensive Learning Guide

### Core Concepts and Architecture
1. **Q: What are the main components of a large language model?**
   A: A large language model consists of two essential components:
   - A parameters file (weights of the neural network)
   - A run file (code that executes the neural network)
   Example: Llama 2 70B's parameters file is ~140GB (each parameter stored as 2 bytes), and the run file can be as simple as ~500 lines of C code with no dependencies.

2. **Q: What is the significance of open weights vs closed models?**
   A: Open weights models (like Llama 2) have their architecture and parameters publicly available, while closed models (like ChatGPT) keep their architecture and parameters private. This affects:
   - Transparency and reproducibility
   - Customization potential
   - Security considerations
   - Research and development opportunities
   - Community contributions and improvements

3. **Q: What is the Transformer architecture and why is it crucial for modern LLMs?**
   A: The Transformer architecture is the neural network foundation of modern LLMs, crucial because it:
   - Processes sequential data efficiently
   - Captures long-range dependencies in text
   - Enables parallel processing of input sequences
   - Forms the foundation for modern LLM capabilities
   - Allows for better scaling with model size
   - Supports attention mechanisms for context understanding

### Training and Learning
4. **Q: What are the two main stages of training an LLM and how do they differ?**
   A: The two main stages are pre-training and fine-tuning:
   - Pre-training (Stage 1):
     * Involves compressing a large chunk of internet text (~10TB)
     * Requires massive computational resources (~6,000 GPUs, ~12 days, ~$2M)
     * Creates a "lossy compression" of the internet
     * The model learns to predict the next word in a sequence
     * Through this task, the model implicitly learns about the world
   
   - Fine-tuning (Stage 2):
     * Transforms the model into an "assistant"
     * Uses high-quality, manually created Q&A datasets
     * Quality over quantity (~100,000 carefully crafted conversations)
     * Changes the model's behavior to respond in a helpful assistant format
     * Remarkably, the model retains knowledge from pre-training while adopting new behavior

5. **Q: What is meant by "lossy compression" in the context of LLMs?**
   A: Lossy compression refers to how LLMs store knowledge - they don't store exact copies of training data but rather learn patterns and general knowledge, similar to how JPEG compression doesn't store exact pixel values. This:
   - Allows for efficient storage of vast amounts of information
   - Enables generalization to new situations
   - Can lead to hallucinations (generating plausible but incorrect information)
   - Explains why models can generate novel content while maintaining coherence
   - Is a fundamental aspect of how LLMs achieve their capabilities

### Advanced Concepts and Behaviors
6. **Q: What is the "reversal curse" in LLMs and what does it reveal about their knowledge storage?**
   A: The reversal curse is a phenomenon where LLMs can answer questions in one direction but not in reverse. For example:
   - Can answer "Who is Tom Cruz's mother?" correctly
   - But fails to answer "Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?"
   This reveals that:
   - Knowledge is stored in a one-dimensional manner
   - Relationships aren't always bi-directional
   - The model's understanding is more pattern-based than conceptual
   - Current architectures have limitations in representing complex relationships

7. **Q: What is meant by "hallucination" in LLMs?**
   A: Hallucination in LLMs refers to when the model generates plausible but incorrect information. This occurs because:
   - The model generates content based on patterns it learned during training
   - It tries to match the style and format of its training data
   - It can create seemingly authentic but fictional content
   - Examples include:
     * Generating Wikipedia-style articles about non-existent topics
     * Creating plausible-looking but non-existent ISBN numbers
     * Providing confident but incorrect answers to factual questions
   - This is a fundamental limitation of current LLM architectures

### Security and Attacks
8. **Q: What are the main types of attacks against LLMs and how can they be mitigated?**
   A: The main types of attacks include:
   - Prompt Injection Attacks:
     * Definition: Manipulating the model's behavior through carefully crafted inputs
     * Types: Direct injection (overriding instructions) and indirect injection (context manipulation)
     * Mitigation: Input sanitization, context window management, system prompt hardening
   
   - Data Poisoning:
     * Definition: Manipulating training data to influence model behavior
     * Impact: Model bias, security vulnerabilities, unintended behaviors
     * Prevention: Careful data curation, validation, and monitoring
   
   - Adversarial Examples:
     * Definition: Inputs designed to cause incorrect or unexpected outputs
     * Types: Text perturbations, semantic manipulations, invisible characters
     * Defense: Adversarial training, input validation, robustness testing

### Future Directions
9. **Q: What is the difference between System 1 and System 2 thinking in LLMs?**
   A: This distinction refers to different modes of cognitive processing:
   - System 1 (Current State):
     * Quick, instinctive responses
     * Example: Simple math problems like "2 + 2" answered instantly
     * Words generated sequentially without deep reasoning
     * Current LLMs primarily operate in this mode
   
   - System 2 (Future Goal):
     * Slower, more deliberate thinking
     * Example: Complex calculations like "17 * 24" with step-by-step reasoning
     * Ability to think through possibilities like a chess player
     * Converting time into accuracy for better results
     * Future LLMs aim to incorporate these capabilities

10. **Q: What is the emerging operating system concept for LLMs?**
    A: LLMs are evolving beyond chatbots to become more like operating systems that can:
    - Coordinate multiple resources and tools
    - Manage memory and computational resources
    - Integrate various capabilities:
      * Text processing and generation
      * Internet browsing
      * File reference and retrieval
      * Software tool integration
      * Image and video processing
      * Audio processing and generation
      * Music generation
    - Handle complex multi-step tasks
